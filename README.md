## Introduction

In recent years, Large Vision-Language Models have made significant advancements, demonstrating robust perception and reasoning capabilities concerning visual information. We would like to know whether LVLMs have a sufficient understanding of faces and human bodies. To this end, we have developed the Face-Human-Bench, which encompasses evaluations across ten distinct capabilities: Facial Attribute Recognition, Age Estimation, Facial Expression Recognition, Face Attack Detection, Face Recognition, Human Attribute Recognition, Action Recognition, Spatial Relation Understanding, Social Relation Understanding, and Person Re-Identification. Some of these capabilities can be further subdivided into multiple sub-capabilities, as illustrated in the figure below.
